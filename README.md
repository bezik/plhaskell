plhaskell
=========

Fed up of writing `plpgsql`? So am I. This project hopes to create a `plhaskell` language extension
for PostgreSQL. However, I am new to writing PostgreSQL extensions, so I could do with help. If
this interests you, contact me at ollie@ocharles.org.uk. Otherwise, you better hope I can figure
this out!
